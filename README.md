Directory Local Configurations

## In Progress
- Inheritance between environments

## TODOS
- Encrypted config file; or at least options
- Override individual options with env vars
- Pull values from password manager (pass, onepass)

## DONE
- Recursively find config files
- Always specify a file name to look for instead of hardcoding a static name; default to "config.???"
- Allow different environments based on NODE_ENV
